    "title": "About Malayalam Font",
    "description1": "Malayalam (മലയാളം) is the native language of the Malayali ethnic group and is an official language of the Indian state of Kerala. It belongs to the Dravidian language family, specifically the South Dravidian branch, which also includes major languages like Tamil and Kannada. Malayalam is written using the Malayalam script, which is one of many scripts derived from the ancient Brahmi system. It is an abugida, meaning that unlike alphabets such as Greek or Latin, it is not written with complete vowels. The 36 consonants of Malayalam are written in full, and vowels are represented with diacritics that modify the consonant letters.",
    "description2": "The 16th-century poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan is credited with popularizing a Malayalam writing system that combined the local Sanskrit script and Vatteluttu script, forming the basis for today's Malayalam script. He is popularly considered the father of modern Malayalam language. In 2013, Malayalam was designated as the fifth Classical Language of India. You can use our text generator below to quickly generate logos or images in the Malayalam style. After creating your design, you can right-click on the image to save it or click on the EMBED button to get links to embed images on the web."
