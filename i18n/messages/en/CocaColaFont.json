    "title": "About Coca-Cola Font",
    "description1": "Coca-Cola is a carbonated beverage made by the Coca-Cola company based in Atlanta, Georgia. The brand name originates from its two key ingredients: cocaine and caffeine, which are extracted respectively from the coca leaf and the kola nut, hence its name Coca-Cola. The Coca-Cola logo was created by Frank Mason Robinson in 1885 and the lettering style used for the logo is known as Spencerian script, which flourished from 1850 to 1925 in the United States.",
    "description2": "The lettering of the logotype is very similar to a font named Coca Cola II and you can download the font for free here. Loki Cola by Utopia is another similar font and it has more swash options. Alternatively, you can use our text generator below to quickly generate logos or images in the Coca-Cola style. After creating your design, you can right-click on the image to save it or click on the EMBED button to get links to embed images on the web."
