    "description1": "Brat is the sixth studio album by English singer Charli XCX, released through Atlantic Records on 7 June 2024. The front album art shows the album title in all lowercase in a blurry sans serif on a green background.",
    "description2": "The sans serif looks like Arial Narrow Regular, designed in 1982 by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders. The font family is available as system fonts on both Windows and MacOS, and also available for licensing at Myfonts. If you want to recreate the low resolution text effect in the album cover, or the mirrored text art seen on the remix album, you can use the text generator below."
