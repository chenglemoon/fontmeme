    "q4": {
      "question": "What's the difference between Gazzetta Slanted and Steelfish fonts?",

    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How can I make text look exactly like the album cover?",
      "answer": "To match the album cover style, use Steelfish Bd It or Steelfish Eb It font with a slanted/italic appearance. The original uses Gazzetta Slanted's variable format. You can adjust the font size, add subtle shadows, and use colors that match the album's aesthetic for best results."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Is The Life of a Showgirl font available for download?",
      "answer": "The generator creates text graphics (images) rather than providing downloadable font files. The Steelfish fonts used here are available from Typodermic.
