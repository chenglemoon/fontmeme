    "title": "About Tamil Font",
    "description1": "Tamil (தமிழ்) is the native language of the Tamil ethnic group, and has official status in Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Tamil Nadu state in India. In 2004, it was the first language to be declared one of India's six Classical Languages, before even Sanskrit. Tamil is written using the Tamil script, which is one of many scripts derived from the ancient Brahmi system. It is categorized as an abugida, meaning that unlike alphabets such as Greek or Latin, is not written with complete vowels. The 18 consonants of Tamil are written in full, and vowels are represented with the use of diacritics which modify the consonant letter.",
    "description2": "The earliest confirmed examples of Tamil writing date back to the 3rd century BCE. These early inscriptions used a slightly adapted form of the Brahmi script, called Tamil-Brahmi. Over time, the script evolved through other Brahmic scripts like Grantha, Pallava and Vatteluttu, eventually becoming the modern Tamil script. As is the case with a number of Brahmic scripts of southern India, rounded shapes developed as a result of writing on palm leaves, which tend to tear if written on with straight lines. The Bamini Tamil font family offers multiple styles (Bamini Tamil, Bamini Tamil 01-05) that are perfect for creating Tamil text graphics. Use our Tamil text generator below to create your own Tamil-style text graphics."
