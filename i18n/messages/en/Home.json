    "q1": {
      "question": "How does Font Generator work?",
      "answer": "Just enter your text, choose between copy-and-paste or text-to-image fonts, navigate through all the available options, and copy or download the generated text!"
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What is the difference between copy-and-paste fonts and text-to-image fonts?",
      "answer": "Copy-and-paste fonts use Unicode symbols that are similar to Latin alphabet characters to create stylish text you can paste anywhere online. If you want a wider variety of designs, text-to-image fonts let you use any custom font for your text and download it as an image, which you can print or copy to some places (e.g. a Word document)."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "When pasting copy-and-paste fonts, why do some symbols show up as boxes (☐)?",
      "answer": "This happens when the font, device or app you are using does not support the specific Unicode characters in the text. Not all fonts include every possible character, so if a character is not available, it may be displayed as a box or question mark."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Where can I use copy-and-paste fonts?",
      "answer": "You can use copy-and-paste fonts on any platform that supports text input, including social media, messaging apps, and word processors. Just copy the styled text and paste it wherever you like!"
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Are the fonts free to use?",
      "answer": "Our tool is completely free. All copy-and-paste fonts can be freely used for any purpose, as they are just Unicode characters. For text-to-image fonts, please check the licensing information provided with each font."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can I use my own fonts?",
      "answer": "Our tool currently does not support uploading custom fonts. However, you can use any of the available copy-and-paste or text-to-image fonts provided on our platform."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "How can I bold or italic text on Instagram, Discord or Facebook?",

    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Can I generate fonts for tattoos or logos?",
