    "title": "About Graffiti Font",
    "description1": "Graffiti is usually appeared as graphics or lettering scratched, scrawled, painted or marked in any manner on property. Graffiti has existed since very ancient times in Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. In ancient Rome, people scratched messages on walls to communicate. In modern times, however, graffiti is considered illegal in a lot of countries. But Brazil and Sao Paulo, one of the largest cities in Brazil, is considered to be the current center of inspiration for graffiti artists.",
    "description2": "Graffiti can have different styles such as tagging (the simplest type), throw-up (usually having two or three colors in bubble letters), stenciling (quick way to produce complicated designs), and wildstyle (more complicated and artistic). Depending on your preferences, there are many fonts that can be used for graffiti purposes such as bubble fonts, stencil fonts, and outline fonts. Graffiti fonts can be a good way to study graffiti letters or graffiti alphabet, but you really should learn to express in your style. Use our graffiti text generator below to create your own graffiti-style text graphics."
