    "description1": "Grand Theft Auto is an action-adventure open world video game series first released in 1997. The game allows the players to choose and play a role of a criminal to roam freely in a city and perform various tasks such as bank robberies, assassinations, etc.",
    "description2": "Several logos have been used for the video game series but since Grand Theft Auto III, a consistent logo featuring stacked \"Grand Theft Auto\" text has been used. Its lettering is very similar to a font called Pricedown Black by Typodermic Fonts. While other weights from the Pricedown family are available as commercial fonts, Pricedown Black is available as a free font and you can download for free here. Alternatively, you can use our text generator below to quickly generate logos or images in the GTA style. After creating your design, you can right-click on the image to save it or click on the EMBED button to get links to embed images on the web."
