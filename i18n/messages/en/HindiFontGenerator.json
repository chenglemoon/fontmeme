    "title": "About Hindi Font",
    "description1": "Hindi (हिन्दी) is one of the official languages of India, with English being the other official language. The standard writing system for Hindi is the Devanagari script, one of many scripts derived from the ancient Brahmi system. Devanagari is an abugida, written with 33 consonants in full, while vowels are represented with diacritics that modify the consonant letter. Unlike Greek or Latin alphabets, Devanagari does not distinguish upper and lower case, and is recognizable for being written with a horizontal line at the top of letters.",
    "description2": "Devanagari is one of the Brahmic scripts used to write languages across South and Southeast Asia. Its modern form came into use by the 11th century CE, having evolved from previous scripts like Gupta and Nagari, and ultimately based on the ancient Brahmi script. As well as Hindi, Devanagari is used for writing a variety of other languages such as Sanskrit and Marathi. The Tillana font family is a popular choice for Hindi text, offering multiple weights from Regular to ExtraBold. Use our Hindi text generator below to create your own Hindi-style text graphics."
